You will get access to 130+ videos, 250+ practice problems, 9 hours of content, quizzes in each chapter, and a FREE textbook.



This class is taught by Tanya Zakowich, who went from repeating a year of pre-algebra in 9th grade to graduating with a Mechanical Engineering degree from Columbia University to working at NASA, Boeing, and Virgin Hyperloop-One. In 2021 she started Pink Pencil Math and built a community of 1,400,000+ on TikTok and Instagram.



We will take you step-by-step through important math concepts as we work our way together through 12 chapters:



Your Mathematical Mind

Our World of Numbers

Add & Subtract

Multiply

Divide

Primes, Factors & Multiples

Fractions

Mixed Numbers

Decimals

Percentages

Exponents
